# Airbyte Configuration

This directory contains declarative configuration snippets for the ingestion layer.

- `meta_source.yaml` – Production-ready Meta Marketing API source configured for incremental syncs on `updated_time`.
- `google_ads_source.yaml` – Google Ads source leveraging a custom query with incremental cursor on `segments.date`.
- `linkedin_transparency_stub.yaml` – HTTP-based placeholder for LinkedIn transparency data until a certified connector is available.
- `tiktok_transparency_stub.yaml` – HTTP-based placeholder for TikTok transparency data.

Optional transparency connectors are disabled by default in dbt via the `enable_linkedin` and `enable_tiktok` variables. When Airbyte jobs for these feeds become available, set the variables to `true` in the target profile to incorporate the additional metrics into the warehouse models.

All files assume credentials are injected via a secrets manager templating system. Replace placeholders with the actual workspace UUIDs and connection IDs when provisioning resources.
