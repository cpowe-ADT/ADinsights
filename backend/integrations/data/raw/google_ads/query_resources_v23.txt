Overview
These pages serve as reference for the resources that can be queried in the Google Ads API using GoogleAdsService.SearchStream or GoogleAdsService.Search . To familiarize yourself instead with various reporting concepts, refer to the reporting guide .
Each resource name is linked to to its own page. On each page, the following lists are shown:
Artifacts (resources, segments, or metrics) that can be used in the same SELECT clause with the resource Attributed resources whose fields will not segment metrics, when included in the same SELECT and WHERE clauses of these resource fields
Presented after those lists are the tables consisting of names of resource fields, segments, and metrics that can be included in a search query, when this resource is specified in the FROM clause. Each name is linked to the table that contains its metadata:
category data type type URL filterable selectable sortable repeated
Filterable This row indicates whether the field can be used in the conditions of the WHERE clause of the GAQL query. Selectable This row indicates whether the field can be specified in the SELECT clause of the GAQL query. Sortable This row indicates whether the field can be sorted and used in the ORDER BY clause of the GAQL query. Repeated This row indicates whether the field is repeated , which should be handled as a list.
List of all resources
Resource types
accessible_bidding_strategy	Represents a view of BiddingStrategies owned by and shared with the customer. In contrast to BiddingStrategy, this resource includes strategies owned by managers of the customer and shared with this customer - in addition to strategies owned by this customer. This resource does not provide metrics and only exposes a limited subset of the BiddingStrategy attributes.
account_budget	An account-level budget. It contains information about the budget itself, as well as the most recently approved changes to the budget and proposed changes that are pending approval. The proposed changes that are pending approval, if any, are found in 'pending_proposal'. Effective details about the budget are found in fields prefixed 'approved_', 'adjusted_' and those without a prefix. Since some effective details may differ from what the user had originally requested (for example, spending limit), these differences are juxtaposed through 'proposed_', 'approved_', and possibly 'adjusted_' fields. This resource is mutated using AccountBudgetProposal and cannot be mutated directly. A budget may have at most one pending proposal at any given time. It is read through pending_proposal. Once approved, a budget may be subject to adjustments, such as credit adjustments. Adjustments create differences between the 'approved' and 'adjusted' fields, which would otherwise be identical.
account_budget_proposal	An account-level budget proposal. All fields prefixed with 'proposed' may not necessarily be applied directly. For example, proposed spending limits may be adjusted before their application. This is true if the 'proposed' field has an 'approved' counterpart, for example, spending limits. Note that the proposal type (proposal_type) changes which fields are required and which must remain empty.

Depending on the format, an ad can show from zero to several products, so the numbers may not match.
