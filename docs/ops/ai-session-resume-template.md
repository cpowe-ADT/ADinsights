# AI Session Resume Template (v0.1)

Purpose: copy/paste for new Codex sessions to rebuild context fast.

## Paste this at session start
```
I am resuming work on ADinsights. I will:
1) Read AGENTS.md (guardrails, tests, schedules).
2) Open docs/ops/doc-index.md for navigation.
3) Identify the active workstream in docs/workstreams.md.
4) Review docs/project/feature-catalog.md and phase1-execution-backlog.md.
5) Confirm scope is a single top-level folder.
6) Run the canonical tests for that folder before finishing.
```
