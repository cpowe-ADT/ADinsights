# Documentation Snob Review (v0.1)

Reviewer persona: strict, picky, and detail-obsessed.

## Findings
1) **Too many entry points**: The repo has several onboarding docs. This is good for completeness, but it needs a single, “golden path” page.  
2) **Too many lists, not enough narrative**: Some docs are checklists only. Add small narratives where flow matters.  
3) **Index coverage is solid**: `docs/ops/doc-index.md` is now comprehensive and well‑linked.  
4) **Versioning is uneven**: Some docs are versioned (v0.1), some are not. Standardize.  
5) **Ownership clarity is improving**: Feature ownership map helps, but update it when owners change.  
6) **Missing “why now”**: Some planned items aren’t clearly tied to business outcomes. Add short “why” lines.  

## Recommendations
- Create a single “golden path” onboarding doc that links out to detail pages.
- Add short “why this matters” lines for backlog items.
- Standardize version headers across new docs.
- Keep doc updates in PR checklists.

## Score
**8.2 / 10** — excellent structure, could be simplified for first‑time readers.
