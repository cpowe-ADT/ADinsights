# AI Engineer Onboarding Checklist (v0.1)

Purpose: fast re-context for Codex/AI sessions.

## First 5 minutes
- Read `AGENTS.md` and the Recontextualization Workflow section.
- Open `docs/ops/doc-index.md` to locate relevant docs.
- Confirm workstream scope in `docs/workstreams.md`.

## Before coding
- Check `docs/project/feature-ownership-map.md` for owner + tests.
- Review `docs/project/feature-catalog.md` for current status.
- If cross-folder changes are required, stop and flag Raj/Mira.

## After coding
- Run the canonical tests for the touched folder.
- Update runbooks/docs if behavior changed.
- Log the session in `docs/ops/agent-activity-log.md` if needed.
