# Ops Dashboard Links (v0.1)

Purpose: single location for monitoring dashboards and what to check.

## Core Dashboards

- **API Health**: check latency, 5xx rate, and uptime.
- **Airbyte Syncs**: success rate, last sync per tenant, error counts.
- **dbt Runs**: run duration, failure rate, freshness.
- **Celery Tasks**: queue depth, retries, success rate.

## Notes

- Add actual URLs once dashboards are provisioned.
- Keep this file updated as dashboards change.
