# ADinsights Deck Review (Consulting-Style)

## Review Method
A simulated consulting-style review was performed using a strategy communication rubric inspired by top-tier advisory standards:
- Headline-driven storyline (each slide title must state a takeaway)
- MECE grouping (clear stakeholder and value segmentation)
- Executive readability (low text density, clear action asks)
- Decision orientation (explicit ownership and next steps)

## Feedback Summary
1. Titles were descriptive but not always decision-oriented.
2. Storyline needed stronger "so what" headlines for executive flow.
3. Role-based value was present but needed tighter commercial vs delivery framing.
4. Risk slide needed clearer mitigation ownership language.
5. Final ask needed stronger action verb framing.

## Improvements Applied
1. Rewrote slide titles into action/takeaway headlines.
2. Tightened wording to reduce ambiguity and improve executive scan speed.
3. Structured value slide into two clear columns: commercial and delivery stakeholders.
4. Kept mitigation statements concise and directly tied to operational controls.
5. Preserved final slide as concrete decisions + immediate next action.

## Visual Standards Confirmed
- Theme: orange brand treatment with white titles and black body text.
- Typography: Calibri for titles, Arial for all body/caption text.
- Format: consistent header bar, spacing, margins, and chart placement.
